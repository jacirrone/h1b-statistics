# Problem

A newspaper editor was researching immigration data trends on H1B(H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) visa application processing over the past years, trying to identify the occupations and states with the most number of approved H1B visas. She has found statistics available from the US Department of Labor and its [Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis). But while there are ready-made reports for [2018](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2018/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2018_Q4.pdf) and [2017](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2017/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2017.pdf), the site doesn’t have them for past years. 

As a data engineer, you are asked to create a mechanism to analyze past years data, specificially calculate two metrics: **Top 10 Occupations** and **Top 10 States** for **certified** visa applications.

Your code should be modular and reusable for future. If the newspaper gets data for the year 2019 (with the assumption that the necessary data to calculate the metrics are available) and puts it in the `input` directory, running the `run.sh` script should produce the results in the `output` folder without needing to change the code.

# Input Dataset

Raw data could be found [here](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) under the __Disclosure Data__ tab (i.e., files listed in the __Disclosure File__ column with ".xlsx" extension). 
For your convenience we converted the Excel files into a semicolon separated (";") format and placed them into this Google drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nti6ClUfibsXSQw5PUIWfVGSIrpuwyxf?usp=sharing). However, do not feel limited to test your code on only the files we've provided on the Google drive 

**Note:** Each year of data can have different columns. Check **File Structure** docs before development. 

# Instructions

We designed this coding challenge to assess your coding skills and your understanding of computer science fundamentals. They are both prerequisites of becoming a data engineer. To solve this challenge you might pick a programing language of your choice (preferably Python, Scala, Java, or C/C++ because they are commonly used and will help us better assess you), but you are only allowed to use the default data structures that come with that programming language (you may use I/O and other standard libraries). For example, you can code in Python, **but you should not use Pandas or other external libraries**. 

***The objective here is to see if you can implement the solution using basic data structure building blocks and software engineering best practices (by writing clean, modular, and well-tested code).*** 

# Output 

Your program must create 2 output files:
* `top_10_occupations.txt`: Top 10 occupations for certified visa applications
* `top_10_states.txt`: Top 10 states for certified visa applications

Each line holds one record and each field on each line is separated by a semicolon (;).

Each line of the `top_10_occupations.txt` file should contain these fields in this order:
1. __`TOP_OCCUPATIONS`__: Use the occupation name associated with an application's Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code
2. __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__: Number of applications that have been certified for that occupation. An application is considered certified if it has a case status of `Certified`
3. __`PERCENTAGE`__: % of applications that have been certified for that occupation compared to total number of certified applications regardless of occupation. 

The records in the file must be sorted by __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__, and in case of a tie, alphabetically by __`TOP_OCCUPATIONS`__.

Each line of the `top_10_states.txt` file should contain these fields in this order:
1. __`TOP_STATES`__: State where the work will take place
2. __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__: Number of applications that have been certified for work in that state. An application is considered certified if it has a case status of `Certified`
3. __`PERCENTAGE`__: % of applications that have been certified in that state compared to total number of certified applications regardless of state.

The records in this file must be sorted by __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__ field, and in case of a tie, alphabetically by __`TOP_STATES`__. 

Depending on the input (e.g., see the example below), there may be fewer than 10 lines in each file. There, however, should not be more than 10 lines in each file. In case of ties, only list the top 10 based on the sorting instructions given above.

Percentages also should be rounded off to 1 decimal place. For instance, 1.05% should be rounded to 1.1% and 1.04% should be rounded to 1.0%. Also, 1% should be represented by 1.0%

# Tips on getting an interview

## What we are looking at
As a data engineer, it’s important that you write clean, well-tested, well-documented code that scales for a large amount of data. For this reason, it’s important to ensure that your solution works well for a large number of records.
Your solution should safisfy the following requirements:
* Repo follows the required repo directory structure
* `run.sh` script works as is in our environment and correct results are generated. If your code needs to be compilied before being executed, you must modify this script to include both compiling and executing your code
* The code is well-commented
* `README.md` contains Problem, Approach and Run instructions sections

You may write your solution in any mainstream programming language, such as C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, or Scala. 
Once your solution satisfies all requirements listed above, submit a link of your Github or Bitbucket repo with your source code.


## Repo directory structure

The directory structure for your repo should look like this:
```
      ├── README.md 
      ├── run.sh
      ├── src
      │   └──h1b_counting.py
      ├── input
      │   └──h1b_input.csv
      ├── output
      |   └── top_10_occupations.txt
      |   └── top_10_states.txt
      ├── insight_testsuite
          └── run_tests.sh
          └── tests
              └── test_1
              |   ├── input
              |   │   └── h1b_input.csv
              |   |__ output
              |   |   └── top_10_occupations.txt
              |   |   └── top_10_states.txt
              ├── your-own-test_1
                  ├── input
                  │   └── h1b_input.csv
                  |── output
                  |   |   └── top_10_occupations.txt
                  |   |   └── top_10_states.txt
```
#### Code Structure

**`DataFrame`** : Data structure inspired by pandas DataFrame

**`Main`** Main file to actually compute the top 10 stats

# Run Instructions

Copy the input file h1b_input.csv to the input folder `./input` and run `sh run.sh`.
